May Allaah reward you and may Allaah bless you. May Allaah inspire you to do the right thing and guide you to the truth. May Allaah benefit us from what we heard, and may Allaah forgive us, you and all Muslims, Amen. The questioner says, O Sheikh, in many schools in Muslim countries in the educational system, the students stand up when the teacher enters. Is this permissible?
They infer this from the words of the poet: Stand up for the teacher and give him veneration. The teacher is almost a messenger. Some of them read it as a verse and hadith. This action is included in the hadith of the Prophet, may Allaah’s prayers and peace be upon him, forbidding people to stand up for him, and the people of knowledge have many fatwas prohibiting that. The advising teacher should prevent his students from doing so. If he enters, the students stand up, and if he sits, they sit. This is included in the prohibition and warning that was mentioned before. Yes.
Questioner says: Is it established in the Sunnah that the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, used to stand for the Prophet, may Allaah’s prayers and peace be upon him, when greeting him and shaking hands with him?
What is indicated by the Sunnah is that standing, if it is for a purpose, and is not just for the purpose of standing up only to venerate, or to imitate a person standing in veneration for him, if it is for a purpose, then there is nothing wrong with it. And we had many different conversations that indicate this, whether the purpose was peace or the purpose was to help “Stand up to your master” or the purpose of embracing, like what passed with us in a case in the story of Jabir with Abdullah bin Anis. If it was for a purpose, then there is nothing wrong with it. It is about him. To stand up to him as veneration, as Imam Al-Bukhari, may Allaah have mercy on him, said, “The chapter on a man standing up to a man as veneration,” that is, for this reason only. Also, once with us, Aisha stood up to Fatimah standing up for her father, if he entered, she stood up and greeted him, kissed him, kissed him, and seated him. All of these are if it is for a legitimate purpose. He took his place in the council, and they sat, neither for peace nor for embracing, nor for help, nor for any other purpose, but only for glorification.
He says does he accept the head of the old woman without kinship?
The precaution is not to do that. As a precaution, he should not do that, neither shaking hands nor kissing the head, as long as he is not a mahram. And it is enough to say hello to her
He says: Is it permissible for the traveler to fast a voluntary fast?
 It is permissible for the traveler to fast voluntary fasts, it is permissible for him to do so, and it is better not to fast, yes
 A question, perhaps a woman says: I came from a far country, and before I arrived in Madinah, I had menstrual blood on the way. Is it permissible for me to perform the rituals of Umrah? How is that note of that date back to a specific country?
 If you know from yourself that you will purify yourself before traveling at the time specified for the end of the journey, then when you reach the meeqaat with the company, you will purify yourself, you will perform ghusl and intend to perform the Umrah, and you will remain in a state of ihram until you purify yourself. After the end of the journey, do not perform Umrah unless it is possible for someone to stay with you until the completion of the Umrah and then travel. May Allaah reward you. Glory be to Allaah and praise be to you
