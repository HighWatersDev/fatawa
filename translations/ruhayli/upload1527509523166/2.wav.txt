Clarification on silent consensus among the companions
The questioner says, why did we not consider the fatwa of the two noble companions, Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas, may Allaah be pleased with them, as a matter of silent consensus, because it was not reported from the Companions that they differed them?
This is a foundational matter, because the silent consensus, which is a weak consensus, is prevented by the slightest impediment. One of the impediments to consider saying unanimous for Sunnah to be known. Saying my opinion does not need to be denied because it is not a denial and the Sunnah is well known and widespread. This is the case in the fatwas of the two companions, the jurists Ibn Omar and Ibn Abbas, may Allaah be pleased with them and their parents. It is my opinion. We knew his evidence and we knew that the evidence does not indicate him. The Sunnah is well known and widespread. That is why Imam Ahmad, the imam of the Sunnis, said in this matter, I go to the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, and I do not go to the narration of Ibn Abbas. I go with the regular year and I don't go to the track of Ibn Abbas for what we mentioned. Therefore, brothers of jurisprudence, not everyone gets it. And if you want to be a jurist, an investigator, an auditor, then be a fundamentalist. And many of those who speak in jurisprudence do not know of the assets except its husks. Therefore, they deny the sayings of imams and scholars that are strong, because they did not master the principles of jurisprudence.
