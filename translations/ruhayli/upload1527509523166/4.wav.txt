Hajj and Umrah
Ruling on one who falls asleep during Tawaaf on a cart
The questioner says: What is the ruling on one who falls asleep during Tawaaf on a cart driven by someone else one or two rounds?
If he slept deeply until he lost his sense of those around him, then his tawaaf is invalid. Because prolonged sleep invalidates ablution. And purity is a condition for the validity of tawaaf. He must perform ablution and repeat the tawaaf from the beginning, whether that happened when he was close or far away, he must come back and perform the tawwaf and the subsequent rights of Umrah so that his Umrah is valid. But if he sleeps sitting down lightly, his feeling does not go away, but his feeling becomes less, so that he hears people's words, but his perception is weak. He is slightly over-drowsy, not drowsy, slightly over-drowsy and not asleep. This is a light sleep. This does not harm his tawaaf, even if it is long, even if it takes a full round, as long as it does not become deep sleep, but it is a light sleep. This is most correct from the sayings of scholars. Of course, this, my brothers, is for tawaaf. As for saa’i, purification is not required for saa’i. But sleep must not take a full path from beginning to end. Because the sleeper does not do it. So if he sleeps part of the round and wakes up part of the round, then his saa’i is correct
