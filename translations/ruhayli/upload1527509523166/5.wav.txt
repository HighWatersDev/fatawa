Hajj and Umrah
Is it permissible to perform Umrah for a person who is in debt?
The questioner says: Is it permissible to perform Umrah for a person who is in debt and did not seek permission from the owner of the debt?
The debt for Hajj or Umrah can either be deferred to a date that did not come, or by installments. I mean, you borrowed money to return after five years. The term hasn't come yet. Or the debt is in installments over months. This does not prevent Umrah or Hajj, nor does it oppose it. Like what some people say to his brother, he says from your hardship to your ease. When will I repay you? From your hardship to your ease. Whenever the debt is facilitated. This is if going to Umrah or Hajj prevents the fulfillment of the debt and staying in the country leads to the fulfillment of the debt. It is not permissible for him to go to Umrah or Hajj, and he does not need permission. But if going to Umrah or Hajj does not affect the payment of the debt. I have money that I can perform Umrah with and pay off the debt. It is permissible for me to leave while the debt is on me, because I have promise. Likewise, if the money with which I will go to Umrah or Hajj does not fulfill the debt, and if I remain, I will not fulfill the debt. There is also nothing wrong with going to Umrah or Hajj. So when does debt prevent Umrah or Hajj? If the debt is immediate or absolute and the going opposes the fulfillment of the debt, here the right of the creation takes precedence over the right of the Creator, unless the creation waives his right. The owner of the debt said, alright, I postpone the debt for two years. Go for Umrah. In this case, it is okay.
