Fasting
Ruling on the intention of  the one who broke the fast during Ramadan
May Allaah be good to you and bless you and benefit Islam and the Muslims. The questioner says if at the beginning of the month he intended to fast the whole month and then passed out at night while he was preparing the intention and did not come to his senses until after dawn, is that sufficient for him?
His intention was cut off because he broke his fast that day. And whoever breaks the fast during the day during the month of Ramadan needs a new intention. This is the rule:  whoever breaks the fast during Ramadan needs a new intention.
