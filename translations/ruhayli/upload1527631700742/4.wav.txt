Fasting
Ruling on fasting for those who travel from one country to another
May Allaah reward you. The questioner says: We fasted with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia here, so if we return to our country at the end of Ramadan, should we follow the Kingdom as well on the day of Eid, or do we agree with our country?
If your people fasted for 30 days, then fast with them. I mean, you fasted 30 days with them, so fast with them. And if you fast for 29 days with the agreement of your people, then fast with them and break your fast. As for if you will fast for 28 days and if you break your fast with your people and it is established that they broke their fast by sighting the new moon or completing 30 days of Ramadan, then break the fast with them and make up a day. But if it is not proven that they broke their fast in a correct way, then fast that day on which they break their fast. And if you fear fitnah, conceal your fast. If you go and your people break their fast, either you have completed a 30-day fast, so break your fast with your people. Or if you fasted for 29 days, then break your fast with your people, even if they fasted for 30 days, and you do not have to do anything. Or that you have fasted 28 days and they fasted 29 days, and their breaking the fast was proven by a correct way, which is the sighting of the crescent, as long as we said 29 days, so break the fast with them and make up that day, because the month is not less than 29 days.
