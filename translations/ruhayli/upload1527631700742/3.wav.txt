Hajj and Umrah
Ruling on making Umrah for the dead who performed Umrah before
May Allaah bless you, may Allaah heal you. The questioner says: My father, may Allaah have mercy on him, passed away. He performed ‘Umrah and Hajj before, so is it permissible for me to perform ‘Umrah on his behalf?
Yes, if you performed the Umrah for yourself, it is permissible for you to perform the Umrah on behalf of your dead father, even if he performed the obligatory Umrah. This indicates in that the Prophet, may Allaah’s salah and peace be upon him, when he heard the man saying "Labeika on bahelf of Shibrima". He may Allaah’s salah and peace be upon him said: who is Shibrima? A brother of mine or a relative of mine said. He may Allaah’s salah and peace be upon him said: Did you perform Hajj on your own behalf? he said no. He may Allaah’s salah and peace be upon him said perform Hajj on your own behalf, then perform Hajj on behalf of Shibrima. He did not ask about Shibrima. Was he a pilgrimage or did he not perform a pilgrimage, even though it is possible that the man was likely to perform a pilgrimage, and that is why he asked him, did you perform the pilgrimage on your own behalf? It is possible that Shibrima performed the pilgrimage with Abu Bakr, then he died, and the Prophet, may Allaah’s salah and peace be upon him, did not elaborate. Whether he performed Umrah or Hajj previously, or he did not perform Umrah, and he did not perform Hajj previously, so there is no harm, praise be to Allaah
